## Case study

My case study is SentinelNaija – Cybersecurity incident management. I designed the database for incident coordinators, response analysts and management reviewers, with separate tables named analyst, incident and incident_event. It supports these operations: register incidents and assign an analyst; record timestamped response events; review incident status and summarize response activity.

## Portfolio 1: Database Design and Modelling

I organised the relational design into 3 tables. Primary keys identify records, foreign keys preserve the links, and checks enforce the stated business rules. Incident severity must be an integer from 1 through 5. The normalisation examples show the sample data at 1NF, 2NF and 3NF. All 10 deliberately invalid inserts were rejected without changing the valid sample rows.

## Portfolio 2: Query Processing and Optimisation

I ran four SQL queries against the sample records. The join returned 1 rows and included Synthetic access alert with Amina Okafor. For the index comparison, I used 50,000 separate performance rows. The median lookup time changed from 2.369 ms to 0.251 ms. Both phases returned the same records. The measured plan used the new index. These timings apply to this lookup and environment.

## Portfolio 3: Transactions and Concurrency

I used a temporary counter on incident to test COMMIT, ROLLBACK and READ COMMITTED isolation. The uncommitted update remained hidden from the other session, and ROLLBACK restored the earlier committed value. Without locking, two increments left the counter at 2. With SELECT FOR UPDATE, Session B waited for Session A and the final value was 3. The helper is confined to this exercise; the case's original business fields stay unchanged.

## Portfolio 4: NoSQL and Advanced Data Models

I used incident_event_stream for the case's event documents. MongoDB inserted 2 sample events and returned the expected results for 4 queries. Validation rejected an invalid date type and a duplicate event ID. Embedded snapshots keep related details with an event, while the details field can differ by event type. These are fictional events; PostgreSQL continues to enforce its relational rules.

## Portfolio 5: Distributed and Cloud Database Exercise

I proposed three MongoDB replica members across separate failure zones. The discussion covers primary elections, majority acknowledgement, secondary lag and sharding trade-offs for incident_event_stream. Replication supports availability, while backups address recovery. PostgreSQL needs its own availability plan. This is the permitted discussion option; no live replica set or failover test was deployed.

## Individual reflection

I kept analyst, incident, incident_event in separate tables so their details could be maintained without repeating them in every related record. Incident severity must be an integer from 1 through 5. The constraint tests check this alongside the required values and record links. One issue illustrated by the two-session exercise is that both sessions can read the same value before either update is committed. Locking the row before reading preserves both increments. The index comparison also shows why I need to check the execution plan as well as the final answer: the same result can require different amounts of database work.

## AI-use declaration

I used GitHub Copilot and the portfolio generator to help prepare the database model, scripts and explanations. The generator ran the PostgreSQL and MongoDB exercises, checked their outputs and captured the result images.  I remain responsible for checking and explaining the submitted work.
